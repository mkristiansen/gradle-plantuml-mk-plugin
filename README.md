# Gradle PlantUML Plugin

======================
Renders plant.uml files in a project as part of a gradle build.
More about [PlantUML on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlantUML).
If you use IntelliJ I also recommend the [PlantUML plugin](https://github.com/esteinberg/plantuml4idea).

## Usage

```gradle
plugins {
  id "io.kristiansen.gradle.PlantUMLPlugin" version "0.0.1"
}
```

You can also apply it with the 'old' Gradle syntax. See the [plugin page](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.`kristiansen.gradle.PlantUMLPlugin).

Place uml files in `${projectDir}/assets/` and then

```bash
gradle renderPlantUml
```

Rendered PNGs and SVGs placed alongside uml.
